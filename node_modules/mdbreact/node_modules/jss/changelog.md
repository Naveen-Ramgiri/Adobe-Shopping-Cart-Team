## 9.1.0 / 2017-10-31

- Added Observable rules. Now not only values can be an observable, but also the entire style object.

## 9.0.0 / 2017-09-30

- Added `SheetsManager.size` getter to get amount of items in `SheetsManager`.
- Refactored `StyleRule.selector` for better performance. Breaking change - it doesn't reregister rule in the classes map any more. It was used mainly in jss-isolate (#419).
- Method `jss.setup()` can now be called multiple times and will merge properly the options. Also it will avoid applying same plugins more than once by comparing the reference (#576).

- Warn when an `insertionPoint` was specified but not found in the DOM.

### Breaking changes for users

- Option `generateClassName` which was used in Jss constructor and `Jss.setup` has been removed. A new option is called `createGenerateClassName` which is a factory that returns the old `generateClassName`. We need this to reset counters on SSR for each request.
- Removed default `insertionPoint` value ("jss") in order to have warnings when insertionPoint is not found in the DOM. With the default one we simply don't know when to warn.

### Potentially breaking changes for plugins

- KeyframeRule has been renamed to KeyframesRule.
- KeyframeRule.type === 'keyframe' => KeyFrames.type === 'keyframes'.
- RegularRule has been renamed to StyleRule
- RegularRule.type === 'regular' => StyleRule.type === 'style'.
- RegularRule.name => RegularRule.key
- ConditionalRule.selector => ConditionalRule.key
- FontFaceRule.selector => FontFaceRule.key
- SimpleRule.name => SimpleRule.key
- ViewportRule.name => ViewportRule.key
- RulesContainer => RuleList

### Breaking changes

- Option "named" has been removed from JSS core and replaced by a jss-global plugin. From now on global styles are only possible using that plugin.
- Sheets are not added to the sheets registry automatically server-side any more. In order to prevent leaking styles between requests, you now need to create your own SheetsRegistry instance and add sheets to it manually. Make sure to create a new instance for each request. On the client, sheets are still automatically added to the registry.
